# DISC4BoTs
Airsim-based drones flying simulations for different scenarios, including malicious behaviours

## Getting Started
First of all, make sure you have downloaded [Airsim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim), you got Unreal engine on your computer, and the [Blocks Enviroment(https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/unreal_blocks/) is set up.
