# DISC4BoTs
Airsim-based drones flying simulations for different scenarios, including malicious behaviours

## Getting Started
First of all, make sure you have downloaded [Airsim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim), you got Unreal engine on your computer, and the [Blocks Enviroment](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/unreal_blocks/) is set up.

Open the Blocks enviroment. It should look like this:

It is recommended to remove all objects to avoid collisions.

It is recommended to change the Perspective field to Top (click Perspective -> top).
